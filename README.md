# Ghidra Scripts
Various different ghidra scripts I have made.

## VTDump
Dumps the selected vtable as C++ code that you can (sometimes) directly copy and paste

## VTStruct
Generates a structure based on the selected VTable. You can then set the vtable pointer to this structure to view which functions are being called more easily in the decompile view.
